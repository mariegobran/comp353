//config.php is the file that contains the credentials

To connect to local database:
-rename the file that does the connection "config.php"

To connect to remote Concordia database:
-rename the file that does the connection "config.php"

.gitignore serves to keep the config.php locally so it does not change the 
credentials for the remote database.
