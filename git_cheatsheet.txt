Git cheat sheet:

//Setting your email address for every repository on your computer

git config --global user.email "email@example.com"

//Setting your email address for a single repository

git config user.email "email@example.com"

// push to heroku
git push -f heroku

//pull from github:
git pull origin master


//delete local branch
git branch -d branch_name
git branch -D branch_name

//delete remote branch
$ git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>

//push to remote branch

git push origin [branch name]


//rollback

git reset --hard “commit_serial_number”




//How to make Git “forget” about a file that was tracked but is now in .gitignore?
git rm --cached <file>

//creating a remote branch. First create it locally and then:
//The current branch creating_pages has no upstream branch.
//To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin new_branch_name


//set git remote heroku to https://git.heroku.com/appname.git

heroku git:remote -a appname


//If you want to deploy code to Heroku from a non-master branch of your local repository
// (such as testbranch), use the following syntax to ensure it is pushed to the remote’s 
//master branch:

git push heroku testbranch:master

// get fresh copy from origin master

git reset --hard origin/master


//hard push to heroku
git push -f heroku master
